<i><b>simple font icons created using css and svg</b></i>


Welcome to **ok_icons**, a project dedicated to creating unique and dynamic icons using only CSS. This project is designed to demonstrate the power of CSS in building complex icons without the need for external libraries or images. 

## Project Overview

In today's web development landscape, having lightweight and scalable icons is essential. CSS icons are part of the DOM, allowing for easy styling and animation directly with CSS. By focusing on pure CSS, we eliminate the need for additional HTTP requests, enhancing performance and efficiency.

### What Youâ€™ll Find Here

Each icon in this repository will be built one day at a time, with a focus on:

- **Minimalism**: Creating clean and straightforward designs that can be easily integrated into any project.
- **Scalability**: Using percentages and "em" units to ensure that icons scale well with different font sizes.
- **Accessibility**: Ensuring that icons are easily clickable and maintain good usability.
- **Animation**: Incorporating smooth animations to enhance user interaction.

## Getting Started

To use the icons in your own projects, simply copy the HTML and CSS code from the respective files. You can also customize the colors, sizes, and animations to fit your design needs.
